Installation
------------

To use the `problexity` package, it will be absolutely useful to install it. Fortunately, it is available in the PyPI repository, so you may install it using `pip`::

  pip install -U problexity

You can also install the module cloned from Github using the setup.py file if you have a strange, but perhaps legitimate need::

  git clone https://github.com/w4k2/problexity.git
  cd problexity
  make install
